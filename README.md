# 📝 TaskFlow - Personal Productivity Companion

**TaskFlow** is a responsive, browser-based Todo Application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. It helps users manage their tasks across three key stages: **Todo**, **Completed**, and **Archived**. This project was developed as part of a front-end assignment to demonstrate skills in DOM manipulation, localStorage persistence, API integration, and responsive UI design.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Landing Page (`index.html`)
- 🔒 **Age Verification**: Users must be older than 10 years to proceed.
- 🧑‍💼 **User Registration**: Form captures user's full name and date of birth.
- ✔️ **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled and age requirement is met.
- 💾 **Data Persistence**: User info is stored in `localStorage` for session continuity.
